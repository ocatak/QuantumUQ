## QuantumUQ

QuantumUQ is a lightweight uncertainty quantification library for **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** with first-class support for **PennyLane** and **Qiskit**.

- **Core idea**: wrap your quantum models as predictors and apply generic UQ methods (shot bootstrap, deep ensembles, noise profiles).
- **Framework-agnostic core**: all uncertainty methods operate on a simple predictor protocol.
- **Designed for research**: small, explicit code; easy to inspect and extend.

See the Quickstart pages for PennyLane and Qiskit for end-to-end examples.
